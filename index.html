I think it is really cool to put at the beginning of the website, and i use my name so i think i can use it as a tag of my work, and the footer gif as well to develop a strong personal style.  -->

        <!-- Placeholder for images The most important aspect of my website is the feeling of a photo gallery. Each image on the homepage represents the cover of a photo collection. I have incorporated numerous interactive effects, such as images arranged diagonally downward, enlarging on hover, and surrounded by a white border to create a glowing effect. This makes the images more engaging and fun. Clicking on any image leads to another page that introduces the photo collection. Each cover hides many interesting photography works. All the images and text on my website are designed to resize according to the webpage dimensions. Also，each image leads to a differently arranged webpage, which adds a lot of visual interest.-->

Sliding text looks more attractive and fun compared to static text, and it can be used to introduce the content of the website. Additionally, I used a gradient border fade effect and shadow on the text itself, making the entire website appear more sophisticated. -->

  <!-- I really like this mouse effect, where the cursor transforms into a glowing small circle. As it moves, a fine line trails behind it, neither too long nor too short. When moving quickly, the end of the trail turns black, making the effect look like a beam of light. This visual impact is striking and was very challenging to perfect. I spent several days tweaking it to achieve the current effect. -->
